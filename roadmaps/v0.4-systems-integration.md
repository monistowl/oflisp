# Roadmap: Version 0.4 – Systems Integration

## Feature Goals

- Host interaction layer providing sandboxed file I/O, networking primitives, and configurable capability grants.
- Embedding API for integrating OFLISP as a library within host applications across multiple languages.
- Package workflow that allows publishing, discovering, and verifying OFLISP modules with signed metadata.
- Observability integrations including structured logging, metrics emission, and health-check hooks.
- Deployment guides covering containerization, configuration management, and monitoring best practices.

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1 – Capability-Oriented I/O
- Define capability tokens representing host resources (files, sockets, timers) with deterministic access policies.
- Implement sandboxed I/O primitives in the runtime that require explicit capability grants from the host.
- Provide configuration schemas to declare capability bundles for different deployment profiles.

### Phase 2 – Embedding & Host APIs
- Expose a stable C FFI along with idiomatic bindings for Rust, Python, and Go hosts.
- Document lifecycle management for embedding (initialization, snapshot loading, execution, teardown).
- Deliver sample host applications demonstrating integration patterns and error handling.

### Phase 3 – Package Ecosystem
- Create tooling for signing and verifying module packages, leveraging existing cryptographic crates.
- Integrate package discovery with a registry index format that can be mirrored for offline use.
- Establish guidelines for semantic versioning, deprecation, and compatibility guarantees.

### Phase 4 – Observability & Operations
- Instrument the runtime with structured logging and metrics sinks compatible with OpenTelemetry.
- Implement health-check endpoints and graceful shutdown hooks for managed environments.
- Author deployment guides for containerized, on-prem, and serverless scenarios.

## Open Questions

- Which signing format (e.g., minisign, OpenPGP) best balances usability and security for package distribution?
- What governance model should manage the central package index and capability policy templates?
